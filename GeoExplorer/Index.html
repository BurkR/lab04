To launch GeoExplorer, locate the GeoExplorer component on the OpenGeo Suite Dashboard, and click the Launch link.

The GeoExplorer web application is usually available at http://localhost:8080/geoexplorer/composer, although your local setup may differ.

To connect to your local GeoServer for read/write access:

Ensure that GeoServer exists in the same servlet container. For example, if your GeoExplorer is at http://example.com/geoexplorer, you will only be able to login to a GeoServer located at http://example.com/geoserver.

Click the Login button on the GeoExplorer toolbar.

Can I log in to and edit a remote GeoServer?
No, only the local GeoServer is supported. GeoServer needs run in the same web application container as GeoExplorer. For example, if your GeoExplorer is at http://example.com/geoexplorer, you will only be able to login to a GeoServer located at http://example.com/geoserver.
